# blogger ‚úç

A cross-platform mobile blog app using Flutter. It's a basic CRUD(create, read, update and delete) application with Firebase as the backend database. It allows authenticated users to use all CRUD features. The version of flutter may be a older version so user needs to update the changes in file as required or the project won't run.
